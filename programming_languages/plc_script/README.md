plc_script is a super tiny programming language intended for learning purposes.
Parsed with an LL(1) parser and interpreted with an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) interpreter
Tokenizer relies on regular expressions input sequnce tokenization


Supported features:

Feel to play with this language and I hope you find it useful while learning about compilers, languages and virtual machines.
